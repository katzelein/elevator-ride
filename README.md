## Elevator Ride!

An elevator system building app that lets you ride the mechanical waves

#### See it in action
- run `npm install`
- run `npm test`

#### Ways to improve
- Store elevators as a dictionary instead of an array to avoid costly array mapping when scaling up number of elevators
- Add logic to check whether an elevator is stopped, going up, going down, or in maintenance
- Write tests to confirm that implementation of sendRequestToNearestElevator actually works!
- Write a script to run the program with examples for the command line instead of using tests
